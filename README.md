## Shopping List: A fundemental Project 
The task set out to us for this project was to create a CRUD web application:  
* **C**reate
* **R**ead
* **U**pdate
* **D**elete  

As the brief for this project was very broad and gives us intellectual freedom given that we create a CRUD based system. I decided not to be flamboyant and simply
create an app that creates a shopping list and calculates the price of the items you need for your list.

## Design
This project is being approached using an agile framework, making use of atlassian to create a Scrum board.

## Thought Approach

When creating this project I thought to myself fill the brief to the best of my ability.
I decided on one table, store everything in users shopping basket, allow them to remove items, and allow them to change the quantity of items on the list.  
And so the shopping list was born:

In order to make the shopping list feel functional I added a feature where you can check off what you picked up and it highlights the item green.
I wanted to take on personal experience of going shopping with a list but no pen and end up missing things because I was unable to tick off what I already had.
An example of that is here:
