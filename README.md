## Grocery Compare: A fundemental Project 
The task set out to us for this project was to create a CRUD web application:  
* **C**reate
* **R**ead
* **U**pdate
* **D**elete  

As the brief for this project was very broad and gives us intellectual freedom given that we create a CRUD based system. I decided not to be flamboyant and simply
create an app that checks what you have in your shopping list with all the leading brand super markets and lets you know which one would be the cheapest.
