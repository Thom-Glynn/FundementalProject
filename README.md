## Shopping List: A fundemental Project 
The task set out to us for this project was to create a CRUD web application:  
* **C**reate
* **R**ead
* **U**pdate
* **D**elete  

As the brief for this project was very broad and gives us intellectual freedom given that we create a CRUD based system. I decided not to be flamboyant and simply
create an app that creates a shopping list and calculates the price of the items you need for your list.
